Prefrontal Cortex:

Role: Decision-making, problem-solving, and executive functions.
Impact on Marketing: This region is involved in rational decision-making and evaluating choices. When consumers evaluate product options or pricing, the prefrontal cortex helps them weigh pros and cons, influencing buying decisions.
Nucleus Accumbens (Part of the Basal Ganglia):

Role: Associated with reward processing and pleasure.
Impact on Marketing: This area lights up when people anticipate rewards or feel pleasure, such as when they see products they desire or enjoy a brand experience. Marketers use this knowledge to create content that triggers positive emotional responses, encouraging purchases.
Amygdala:

Role: Processing emotions, especially fear, pleasure, and excitement.
Impact on Marketing: Emotional advertising targets the amygdala to elicit strong emotional reactions, which can make ads more memorable and products more desirable. Fear-based or excitement-inducing campaigns often leverage the amygdala's response.
Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex (vmPFC):

Role: Emotional regulation and value judgment.
Impact on Marketing: This region helps consumers assess the value of products or experiences. Effective marketing can influence how much value consumers assign to a product, tipping their decisions toward purchasing.
